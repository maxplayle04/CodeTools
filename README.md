"Bits of code that I often need. So heck, why not post them in a public repo?"

This repo is dedicated to hosting snippets of code I often use, and would like to share with other developers. Some bits may make your life easier, and other bits may make you wonder why I'm writing code - either way. I hope they help you somewhat at least! 👍
